# Tic-tac-toe-game
This project is a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python, offering both two-player mode and single-player mode against a basic AI opponent. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns entering their moves (1-9), with input validation ensuring valid and non-overlapping moves.
